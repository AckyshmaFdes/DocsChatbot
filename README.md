# DocsChatbot
This Project focuses on building a Question and Answer Chatbot using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and LangChain that processes PDF documents. The system extracts relevant information from course materials or Company docs, enabling users to ask questions and receive accurate, context-based answers via vector embeddings and LLM integration.
